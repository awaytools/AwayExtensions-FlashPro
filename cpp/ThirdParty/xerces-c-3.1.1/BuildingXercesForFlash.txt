We don't have a metaproject for Xerces yet, and are not doing it due to lack of time. Xerces has 10s of dependent projects, and doesn't ship with an XCode project.
The last XCode project they shipped and maintained was XCode 2.6.
Thus, one would need to build the Xerces project separately, once any newer version of Xerces is integrated.
Note: Other teams using Xerces - MediaCore, Audition, DW, FW (They are all at 3.0.0)
Note: Xerces hasn't been build or tested for 64 bit on Mac, but other Adobe teams are using 3.0.0.
These notes work for 3.0.0 and 3.1.1(currently being integrated by Flash team), and should work for the newer releases too, if followed exactly.


Caution: DONOT try to unshelve files from one platform to another. While, it can be done, there will be a lot more changes and iterations required. 
The easy way is to follow the following steps in order.

Download from http://xerces.apache.org/mirrors.cgi
Xerces C++ 3.1.1 - zip for Win and tar.gz for Mac.

After this, follow these steps

1. Replace all instances of 'id' with something else eg: 'iden'. There are 16 such files (3 in tests) in Xerces 3.1.1. Simply search for exact word, and case 'id' in Visual Studio, and replace all non-comment instances with this.

2. Integrate all changes got from DW (Xerces 2.6). One would need to refer the current history, where I'll be migrating the same changes over in one changelist to Xerces 3.1.1 code. 

Building Xerces:

Mac (univeral binary for 64 bit, you should be able to paste the lines below into the terminal):
---

cd //depot/main/flashpro/src/shared_code/ThirdParty/Xerces-c-3.1.1

./configure --prefix=$PWD/build/Mac/ --enable-transcoder-macosunicodeconverter --disable-dependency-tracking CFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -arch i386" CXXFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -arch i386"

After referring our Mac project settings, I tweaked this as follows. Its safer to use this, rather than the above.

./configure --prefix=$PWD/Build/Mac/ --enable-transcoder-macosunicodeconverter --disable-dependency-tracking CFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -fmessage-length=0 -pipe -Wno-trigraphs -fpascal-strings -fasm-blocks -O3 -Wreturn-type -Wmissing-braces -Wparentheses -Wunknown-pragmas -DDVA_COCOA_UI=1 -DNS_BUILD_32_LIKE_64 -DBOOST_ALL_NO_LIB -DBOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -Wno-deprecated-declarations -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -gdwarf-2" CXXFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -fmessage-length=0 -pipe -Wno-trigraphs -fpascal-strings -fasm-blocks -O3 -Wreturn-type -Wmissing-braces -Wparentheses -Wunknown-pragmas -DDVA_COCOA_UI=1 -DNS_BUILD_32_LIKE_64 -DBOOST_ALL_NO_LIB -DBOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -Wno-deprecated-declarations -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -gdwarf-2" --disable-threads


make

mkdir -p Build/Mac/Release

mv src/.libs/*.dylib* Build/Mac/Release/

mv src/.libs/libxerces-c.a Build/Mac/Release/

mv src/xercesc/util/Xerces_autoconf_config.hpp src/xercesc/util/Xerces_autoconf_config.Mac.hpp

install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../Frameworks/libxerces-c-3.1.dylib Build/Mac/Release/libxerces-c-3.1.dylib


// Note: The mv is imp since the libs are created in an invisible .libs directory and needs to be moved
// Note: The rename to Xerces_autoconf_config.Mac.hpp is xerces places and names both win amd mac files as the same
// Note: The install_name_tool is very important else one would get a crash on launch.

Windows (separate 32 and 64 bit libraries, instructions require human interaction):
-------


Launch in VS2010 the xerces project perforce_Root\depot\main\flashpro\src\shared_code\ThirdParty\Xerces-c-3.1.1projects\Win32\VC9\xerces-all\xerces-all.sln

Select all projects in the Xerces solution and convert all the properties like "Treat wchar_t as Built-in Type" in General/C++ and Linker etc. to match with flash pro seting

Do this for 64 bit, 32 bit and Release (and Debug if reqd) configuration

Build the Release/Win32 configuration of the XercesLib project

Build the Release/x64 configuration of the XercesLib project

move src\xercesesc\util\Xerces_autoconf_config.hpp src\xercesesc\util\Xerces_autoconf_config.Win.hpp




Finally replace in xerces-c-3.1.1\src\xercesc\util\XercesDefs.h  (Imp: After building both Win and Mac projects. This is just so that the files Xerces_autoconf_config which have platform specific verisons are not lost in perforce)

#include	<xercesc/util/Xerces_autoconf_config.hpp>

by

#if defined(MAC_BUILD) || defined(_MAC)
#include	<xercesc/util/Xerces_autoconf_config.mac.hpp>
#else
#include	<xercesc/util/Xerces_autoconf_config.win.hpp>
#endif
